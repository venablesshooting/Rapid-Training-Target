# Rapid Training Target Instructions

I designed this to be simple and effective to use.
There are two components to this device, the Target and the Remote.
## Target
This is designed to be powered by a 5V 500mA USB charger or power bank. It uses USB C and once connected to power is ready to go
It has a 1/4-20 standard tripod thread on the base so that you can use it to mount to a tripod.

## Remote
The remote has a 400mAh battery inside which I have found lasts over several days of training.
If the target is powered pressing one of the buttons will give you 8s, 6s, or 4s series repectively.

The order of the buttons is the USB C charging port is at the bottom and it has the 8s series at the top, the middle is 6s, and the bottom is 4s.

To charge connect the remote to the same power source as used to power the target and the orange light will stop flashing once fully charged. It should 500 charge cycles before any noticeable loss of battery life occurs.
